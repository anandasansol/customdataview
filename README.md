App developers often need to create a view with multiple dataviews, lists and/or containers. In Sencha, we have seen a common problem of multiple scrollbar when a page has many containers. The whole view looks pretty mixed while scrolling any of the containers. Developers often look for a realistic solution to this problem; I have come across many forum discussions on this topic but hardly found a real solution.

Finally, I have come up with my own way of solving it.
